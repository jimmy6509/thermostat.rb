Proliphix Network thermostats.  I was motivated to write this as part
of some simple home temperature monitoring.

h2. The basics

h2. Demonstration of usage

<pre syntax="ruby">
  thermostat = Thermostat.new("hostname", "admin", "password")

  # get the current temperature
  current_temp = thermostat.temp

  # get the current setback heat value
  current_target_temp = thermostat.heat_to

  # set the thermostat to 69F (units are set in the thermostat)
  thermostat.heat_to = 69
</pre>
